Cjdns builds for nycmesh.net nodes
==================================

This will hopefully become a collection of utilities to produce an image for a raspberry pi/beagle bone black/nanostation/etc that includes all the software necessary to start a node on the nycmesh network.

See http://nycmesh.net/ for more information about the larger meshlocal project

Features
--------
* cjdns
    * systemd startup script to automatically generate cjdns config with ETHInterface
    * automatically generate .cjdadmin for web interface
* web interface to cjdns configuration (nodejs in contrib?)
* gateway from local network to cjdns network (https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/nat-gateway.md)
    * ip6tables configuration
    * radvd to broadcast route
    * configure static ipv6 on eth0
* DNS

Setup
-----
The idea is to have an image setup that does this for you, but until then:
1. Put archlinuxarm on your raspberry pi: http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi
2. Get this repository:
    git clone http://github.com/ksnieck/nycmesh-gateway/
3. build the gateway configuration package
    cd nycmesh-gateway/cjdns-gateway
    makepkg
4. you probably will have to visit http://aur.archlinux.org and install dependencies and try again
5. edit /etc/cjdroute.conf and uncomment ETHInterface
6. restart cjdns
    sudo systemctl restart cjdns
